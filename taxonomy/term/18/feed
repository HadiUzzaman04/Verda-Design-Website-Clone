&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=361:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/trends-2023-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;trends-2023-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;trends-2023-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=361 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web design and user experience is a constantly changing sector. Staying on top of current trends is a must and also setting them. The items mentioned below are becoming more prominent in web design as the year goes on. The ability to create a website that shows users an experience when visiting a website is a must in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chatbots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=362:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/live-chat.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;live-chat.jpg&quot; title=&quot;live-chat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=362 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.lululemon.com/live-chat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://shop.lululemon.com/live-chat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-commerce stores operate 24 hours a day so when there is no one to answer an e-mail or call from a new or potential customer a chatbox is a great way to answer simple questions and reduce the number of e-mails to reply to. Large companies such as Lululemon rely heavily on their chatbox especially after-hours. Often with a pre-built response to common questions many inquiries can be resolved with this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parallax Scrolling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=366:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/callout.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;callout.jpg&quot; title=&quot;callout.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=366 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afig.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.afig.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, what is parallax scrolling exactly? Well, it is a technique of presenting elements in the foreground or background that move faster than other elements on a website to create the perception of depth as a user scrolls down the page. This has been used on many websites over the past several years, however in 2023 it is becoming ever more dominant in design and will continue in the foreseeable future. It’s use can be quite subtle, such as only for background images in a section of a website or more of a feature when several elements are used within a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complex Gradients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=367:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/MCO-gradient.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;MCO-gradient.jpg&quot; title=&quot;MCO-gradient.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=367 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themco.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.themco.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradients have been around in web design since the early websites of the 1990’s. Although they are notorious for being a bit of an eyesore, the use of gradients in a subtle yet sophisticated manner are being used to add depth to flat images. For those who prefer the look of a minimalist website and  for flat colors there is a tendency to use gradients which are very gradual and minimal in their transitions. The use of gradients is also used on the top of images in banner or rollover areas to infuse a company’s brand colours as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rounded Corners on Buttons &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=364:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/rounded-buttons-web-design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;rounded-buttons-web-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;rounded-buttons-web-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=364 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reachyouthservices.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://reachyouthservices.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would like to mention that adding rounded buttons and images on a website will largely depend on the company or organization’s branding guidelines. If rounded elements fit within the brand’s aesthetics it’s a great way to tie this into a web page design. Rounded buttons and other elements on websites are being used evermore often as 2023 goes on. This simple technique adds a layer of sophistication and helps to increase the approachability of a website. User experience dictates that slightly more rounded buttons are actually more often pressed on by users when completing an website’s “objective” such as a checkout or callout to contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oversized Typography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=363:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/hero-text-web-design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;hero-text-web-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;hero-text-web-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=363 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling from classic and impactful print design ads, such as Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign, oversize and high-impact typography is used in feature sections of websites in prominent areas such as the banner or other callout sections. Also known as a “hero” section this is often the first visual that users will see when they visit a web page. High impact text tends to leave users with a strong and lasting impression just like traditional print ads tend to do. Simple, yet effective, this trend is becoming ever more seen this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background Color Animated Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=365:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/banner.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;banner.jpg&quot; title=&quot;banner.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=365 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dyndatainc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.dyndatainc.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background colour changes which feature some type of transitional animation are a new and powerful way to transition from light to dark to a page rather than using standard boxlike divisions and backgrounds. This can be done with a fade or other animation which is subtle but provides a level of depth and complexity creating a stunning visual on a website. This can be done from an image to a colour as well. We are seeing more and more designers pushing their creativity on normally simple sections of a website to show the impact colour has on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, many of these trends and techniques have been around for years, however they are being implemented in a more creative manner. We will likely see many other common web design trends take hold in the same way in the next coming months as web designers and web developers push the limits of what a website can do to leave a lasting impression on users.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Our Winnipeg Web Design Firm&#039;s Covid -19 Protocols</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/our-winnipeg-web-design-firms-covid-19-protocols</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=342:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/covid-19-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;covid-19-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;covid-19-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=342 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 has affected changes in most businesses whether your business is online or a traditional brick and mortar store. We at Verda Design have adopted several changes for the safety of our clients. Please rest assured that your health and safety is top priority to us all at Verda Design. Some of these changes are listed below so you can rest assured that we are taking your safety as our number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most meetings have been switched to calls, Zoom chat or other online chatting tools. We work with whichever method of communication our clients are comfortable using to move the project forward as smoothly as possible. This means we can share screens and review your website or brand project online. We are always available for calls as usual and we are operating during our normal business hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Person Meeting in Winnipeg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any in-person meetings at our office we are abiding by the highest standards of cleaning prior to and between meetings. To assure our clients here are some of the guidelines we have been following: cleaning frequently touched surfaces using disinfectant and warm soapy water, practicing the routine cleaning of surfaces such as tables, chairs, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, phone and other devices. For those clients who are more comfortable for us to meet at their office, we can make arrangements for this as well. Our goal is your safety and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, we have increased the level of online support for our clients as we understand that most businesses now are relying heavily on their website and online presence for their customers and users. Living and working through the pandemic can be stressful and our goal is to relieve any issues that our clients have in the utmost timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote Working&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we still have our office located in the Exchange District, we are limiting the number of people there at one time. We are working from home several days of the week to reduce the occurrence of potential spread. This is both important for staff and for limiting any potential exposure to clients. Anyone exhibiting any symptoms will be working from home or be meeting online until cleared for Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our clients, we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your business and hope that you all stay safe during this time. We will do our best to assist you in the future and coming days! Your business is important to us and if you have any questions on how to improve your website or online presence please feel free to contact us any time. We are all in this together and we believe that staying positive and working together will be of great importance moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your website may be blending in with all the other competitors and keeping you from standing apart because of some common content mistakes. While use of text (copy) in your web site is important, adding the use of graphics and images can create more visual interest plus convey ideas and messages instantly. Here is advice from the experts on how to dodge these pitfalls and create a more stylish professional website using three simple but effective ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom High Quality Photos For Your Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most websites include an “About Us” page to let readers know about service providers/staff and where the enterprise is located. This is a great opportunity to include photographs of key staff members, management and/or owners. Use of staff photos creates a connection for the reader before they choose to engage with your organization. Similarly, include a photograph of your location, both building exterior and interior workplace, to create a relatable and positive impression with potential customers. Your website’s “Products and Services” page is also an excellent place to include images of your products and services for marketing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: When including photographs for your website make sure to hire a professional photographer. Amateur photographs can lead potential customers to think your enterprise may also not be professional, so avoid this pitfall and be sure to go for custom high quality images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom Illustrations and Graphics on Your Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set your website apart from competitors, incorporate customized graphics and icons. Graphic designers or illustrators will develop specialized custom graphics and illustrations oriented to your needs. Use of customized icons to depict the “services” you offer are a clever and creative way to make your website experience stand out. Verda Design has designer and illustrator services that can give this “wow” factor for your website and create a lasting impression of your business. Again, you want to be sure to use professionals so that the proper “look and feel” of your business is reflected in the overall design of your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Websites With Video Make an Impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of video in your website creates added visual interest through graphics and movement. Your website can incorporate video for a background in your website banner area and is a great way to add depth and complexity to the website. Also adding a video that discusses your products and services is a great way to inform your audience on what makes you different. Hire a videographer for the video elements as we know that well-made video captures attention unlike anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a few key proven ways that can take your website from “ho hum” to amazing. Use of professional photographers, designers/illustrators and videographers is well worth it when it comes to promoting your business. When planning for your web site or refreshing your current one, make sure to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;include professional graphical content in your website to visitors coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>How to Make Your Website Secure</title>

 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=325:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/make-website-secure.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;make-website-secure.jpg&quot; title=&quot;make-website-secure.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=325 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Making your website more secure is crucial to avoiding your website becoming compromised. Being “hacked” is a real possibility when there are &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; or plug-in/module updates being neglected. That being said there are several security measures you can take that also increase your website’s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt; and boost user confidence when on your website by knowing it is a trustworthy website. The list below highlights a few common and major areas we see that lead to these types of exploits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificate (https) to Your Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;, which is short for “Secure Sockets Layer” is an additional proactive measure you can take to increase your website’s security. In some browsers such as Google Chrome when there is no &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; you may receive a red warning “Not Secure” message in your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. This will often deter users from staying on your website. Some will leave immediately upon reading the warning message. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; are mainly used on websites where payments or other security sensitive data is being transmitted however it will still provide an added layer of protection for your website even if you are not using those features. Having the little green lock your url which says “secure” along with “https” will tell your users that you have their security in mind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update Your Website’s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All software may require periodic updates. This is especially important for anything connected to the web and includes your website. Applying updates and patches that are released for your content management system (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;) will have a direct effect on making it more secure. If you are using an older version of a content management system you may want to upgrade to a newer version. This is especially important if that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; has reached its “end of life” (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EOL&lt;/span&gt;) meaning it is no longer supported. If you are using WordPress, you need to be especially prudent as 78% of all websites that are hacked are WordPress websites. This is largely due to its popularity and ease of use for users of all skill levels which makes it a more lucrative target. It is important to know the issues your chosen &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; may be susceptible to. Make sure to upgrade and make the monthly patches that are released to avoid being exploited.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XSS&lt;/span&gt;-Protection in Your Website’s Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XSS&lt;/span&gt;-Protection helps prevent what is called cross-site scripting attacks, meaning code is added to a website that will issue actions in the user’s browser on behalf of a webpage. Sometimes you may not even be aware that this is occurring on your website. If you are concerned about an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XSS&lt;/span&gt; attack on your website there are actions you can take to prevent this from occurring. If you are unable to code yourself speak to an experienced web developer regarding these issues to make certain you are protected.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use a Password Manager For Your Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Using a password manager seems like a no brainer however sometimes it is one of those things that gets overlooked. There are many free and paid password management services that you can use to make your life easier. Password managers make your website more secure by allowing you to use stronger passwords since you no longer need to memorize them. Choosing an automatically generated password that contains special characters, numbers and both upper and lowercase letters will certainly be advantageous. Keep your passwords for your website under lock and key.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you are still concerned about your website being compromised or hacked speak to us or another experienced web design and development firm for a better understanding of the state of the web in 2018.&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>What to Look For When Choosing a Web Design Company</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/what-look-when-choosing-web-design-company</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=324:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/winnipeg-traffic-web-design1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;winnipeg-traffic-web-design1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;winnipeg-traffic-web-design1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=324 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--END copyright=324--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year in the Web Design Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses come and go, especially businesses in the tech and web design industry. Therefore, when choosing a web design company for your project, it is important for it to have a strong track record and the years of experience to back it up. Selecting a web design company that isn’t a fly by night company will allow you the security and peace of mind knowing that you have someone to turn to when you have questions or need assistance with your website or other related fields such as social media or online marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Quality Websites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look through the web firm’s portfolio to see if you like their style of work. Is it modern and cutting edge or a somewhat dated? It’s important to ask yourself these questions, as the type of work you see now will likely be the type of work you will receive. Select a web design company that projects the style and influence that you would like your new website and business to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pricing &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Maintenance Fees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites prices range from $100 templates to $10,000 e-commerce websites. What and where you are in your business should be reflected in your website. If you are an established company and wish to separate yourself from your competition then having a more custom website would be a great idea. Be aware that prices will range and maintenance fees should be manageable. At Verda Design, for example, our maintenance fees are optional. If you have an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; department or have the know-how you can opt out of any on-going fees. Plus, our pricing will provide you with a flat rate if you have a standard project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most websites are built on content management systems, such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla, to name a few. Having an idea of which content management system you would like may assist you in choosing your web team. Be sure that you going to be provided training and a manual so you are comfortable with accessing the back-end of your website. Some of the items typically covered in training or a manual are how to add and edit images and text, how to add pages and check the contact forms on your website. Another important question to ask is whether you are going to be able to make all the updates yourself or fees will apply for certain areas of the website. Having as much control over the website will save you and your business in ongoing costs over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Design &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Development Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is actually going to be working on your website is equally as important as all of the items mentioned above. Sometimes low prices mean you are being passed off to a junior designer or someone overseas that is the lowest bidder for your project . When considering a company for hire, be sure to ask questions about the qualifications of the person/s who would be working on your project, including their level of education, years of experience, and the skill level of the individual at the company. Your website is the face of your business or organization to the world so be sure you hire the right web designers to build your future website.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>How to Drive More Traffic to Your Website</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/how-drive-more-traffic-your-website</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=320:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/winnipeg-traffic-web-design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;winnipeg-traffic-web-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;winnipeg-traffic-web-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=320 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Driving reoccurring and new traffic to your website is essential for your website’s and business’s success. Whether you are looking to attract new customers or repeat business the following information will assist you in knowing how best to target and engage your customers and get them to your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost is being seen on organic search results. This means when someone types in relevant key words to find your business, product, or service, your website is found in search results. Evaluating your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt; (Search Engine Optimization) by performing an audit is a fundamental starting point to see which areas of your website can be improved. Some common occurrences that often come up on these type of audits are weak content structure, poor wording and website construction. Performing an audit will allow you to focus on the issues of your website that can then be corrected to improve traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Ad Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is still key when it comes to driving traffic. While waiting for your organic results to improve, running paid advertisements on Google Ad Words is a great way to share your business with the world. Unlike traditional print advertising you are targeting users who are looking for your products or services since these ads will show up for users looking for you by searching for relevant key words. Setting up a targeted landing page is a great way to educate users and have them complete the desired action. Whether it is calling a phone number, submitting a form, or buying a product, these landing pages can be designed to meet your objectives and make it easy for users to contact you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mailing List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting an online mailing list is a great way to maintain user engagement. When you have company news, a new product, blog post, service or promotion to share your mailing list is a great tool for sending out a link to the content on your website and drive users to this page. Having an incentive to join a mailing list is also extremely helpful to provide users a reason to plug in their personal information. Often companies will offer a discount or other incentive when a user signs up. Some mailing list services to consider would be a MailChimp, Constant Contact or Active Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Media Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is free, easy and simple. Set up all your social media profiles and begin sharing your content on your website. If you write a new blog post or have some new photos, add them on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Focus on driving traffic back to your website. Engage with users by commenting back to any questions or comments. Providing unique and interesting content will keep you fresh in the minds of prospective and existing customers and also helps build brand recognition and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Media Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step to driving traffic to your website would be to start running targeted social media ads. This can be boasting a post on Facebook in your local city or running ads on Instagram of your new products. There are many ways to get active and engage with users to drive them back to your website. With your ads it is important to add a link to your website for more contact and phone number information in case they prefer that manner in which to reach you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The categories listed above are a great starting point, many of which you can do yourself without paying someone a fee. If you need more assistance with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt; audits or have questions about how to improve your website, contact Verda Design today for your free consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Web Design Trends You Will See in 2018</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/web-design-trends-you-will-see-2018</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;p&gt;We have come a long way from when serif fonts were hard to see on website monitors and screens and from the days of narrow hard to read a website’s minuscule font sizes. As technology has evolved, the way in which we interact with technology has changed. The way we use websites and computers in general has now changed with the swiping on our smart phones to voice recognition.  These advancements come into play from what we expect from design. This article will discuss the biggest trends that are now currently very popular and will continue to rise as the year moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos Take Centre Stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are on social media whether it be Facebook or Instagram every third post now seems to be video. We love the element of story telling and seeing real people, real video imagery to relay our information. Websites that have a good use of whitespace either being displayed as memorable background imagery or to improve a user’s of a company, organization or product tend to grab users attention and replay their message quickly without the need to read. As the year goes on and likely more into the future we will continue to see a raise in high quality video production for the use of websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blog &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Graphic Websites &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Imagery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less is more and often times when we use less design elements, what’s left need to be bold and compelling to the audience. In terms of web design in 2018 we see some parallels to the use of simple photography, such as those used in the 1960’ ads. In web design banners we will often see the sales item with minimal text and showcasing the item. The same goes with people. Unconventional corporate headshots seem to be on the decline as companies look for ways to separate themselves and their people. We often now see more staff photos of people outdoors, interacting with customers or being more casual and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unconventional Grids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans we like order by our nature so when we see grids that seem to have too much space it tends to bother us. As more and more designers adapt more unconventional grid style layouts and the general public becomes accustomed to seeing them it is more mainstream for large websites to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Load In Animations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a web page loads in it used to be the time when every element of the page would look out of place for a moment before the entire website loaded up. Now with the trend of using page load in’s it gives the illusion of elegance and every item falling into place. Some load in animation we often see and will continue to see are fade transitions, slide in from the left, right, bottom or top of the screen, small to big load ins or often times a combination of several effects. As this year moves forward we are likely to see this accelerate and increase as more users now expect to see a more polished look from the moment they click onto a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will watch these trends and write a part two article half way through the year discussing more of my findings and thoughts on them. Overall the clean modern and original aspects of what we are seeing have been very visually pleasing and refreshing and I look forward to what trends come next.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Website SEO Changes In 2016</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/website-seo-changes-2016</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=295:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/seo-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;seo-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;seo-winnipeg-web-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=295 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has made some major updates as of this year, most of which are geared towards improving their orgnaic search terms to provide higher quality results for users, not just on desktop computers. This article will let you know what your website should have to get the best possible rank in this search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Responsive, Mobile Optimized Websites Officially Will Out Rank Desktop Only Websites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a website that is optimized for mobile devices is now imperative to having your website rank well on Google.  This has become expected by website users and now officially by Google as well as of April 21st, 2015 and is only going to play a larger role in rank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about this here on &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6196932?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s Support Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your website does not work on smaller devices such as smart phones, tablets and laptop computers you are going to be docked points from your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt; efforts. It may be time to redo your website to make sure it is accessable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
2. Video Engagement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great video content makes it easier to keep users on your website for longer. Make sure that your videos do not auto-play sound right away as that could deters potential users from staying on your website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites with video embedded within the page tend to rank better than those without. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt; landing pages with a video embeded within them will lead to an 80% higher conversion rate. This strategy of using video to convey a product, service or information about your product, organization or company is a sure way to relay your points across in a manner which the most easily digested amoung users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Content Length Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing articles for a blog or news page it is very important to generate good quality, unique content. By unique it refers to fresh content that is generated by you and not taken from other websites.  Having articles that are informative and well written will keep users on your page longer, contributing to a higher page retention which tells Google “Hey, people are finding this article helpful” thereby adding to the retention  value of that page. Ideally, articles should be over 500 words whenever possible. These articles will stand a much better chance of ranking well and gaining traction among an audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
4. Content Structure Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times users may come across blog posts on a website that are one big long paragraph of text with no titles, bullet points or other types formatting which help a user scan through information. When users read on the web they read differently then on magazines and book. Users are often looking for specialized information within an website, article or blog post. Organizing your content in an manner that makes sense will assist users in finding this information as well as help with your rank by following this protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having a long paragraph of text, break up the articles with headlines for each paragraph, numbered lists, bullet point and images. Keep in mind the object is to make it easy for readers to scan this content and digest the information they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Web Design Trends We Will Continue to See in 2016</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/web-design-trends-we-will-continue-see-2016</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=290:sdl_editor_representation --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/2016-web-design-trends.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;2016-web-design-trends.jpg&quot; title=&quot;2016-web-design-trends.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=290 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-legend-wrapper&quot; contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hamburger Menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hamburger menu has been common place on smart phones and is ideal for opening and closing navigation on these sizes however we are continuing to see it used on large full screen desktop. Many designers love the clean and uncluttered look it creates when applied to a website. This type of navigation although visibly pleasing does have its downsides. Criticized by many user experience analists the hamburger menu which consists of 3 horizontal lines is still unfamiliar with some users. This can cause issues if these user do not know where to click on a website to access the navigation. Hiding all of the navgiation links in this type of menu is frowned upon as a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Longer Scrolling on Websites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are now use to scrolling on websites and web designers have taken advantage of this, giving them more creativity and flow for any given web page. Although having the most important content towards to the top of the web page is still a tried and tested rule, the longer page length allow for more creativity, larger site maps in the footer and overall an more aesthetically pleasing and fun website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Large Background Images &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often known as hero images, these large scale compelling graphic images grace many websites. They immediately emote the brand’s feel when users visit a website. Videos are also increasingly popular for home page banners as a means of conveying the brand message to a large audience quickly and esasily. Large scale images and videos are one for the best ways to make an intimidate impression and grab users attention.  In terms of load times large scale images and videos are usually not an issue due tot he data that is compressed. (add soemthing here about hwo to optimize)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flat, Simplified Web Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalisim and solid colors and simified shapes are popular to see one several websites. Many large websites and brand have helped grow this trend by adapting their bradns and wesbites to the flat minlist look.  For example, Microsoft operating system developed  Windows 10 and the surface pro tablet and … the style has been the go to look for new websites since 2014. Google has also stripped awayt their beveloed stlyed logo an opted for a clean sans-serif typeface wihtout any affects applied tot heir logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to the flat trend in web design, it was allowed designers to focus on user expenice and stripping away the clutter and unnessary elemetns, it has allowed web design to focus on creating a fresh user and unobstrusive expereicence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Responsive Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive web design has really solidified its place in the the web design industry becoming a go to standard for any website that needs to operate and function well on mobile devices. Allowing for all of the content to resize to any device it has defined what websites can do and how they function going forward. The website administrator no longer has to update both desktop and mobile websites since the responsive website is now all in one. With ease of use for updating content id it now the standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many new developments and rules when creating an responsive website to maximize user experience. A few include using responsive tablets for better formatting,  utilizes responsive images and avoiding using java script…&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Creative Director &amp; Web Designer At Verda Win&#039;s Young Entrepreneur Award</title>
 <link>https://www.verdadesign.com/blog/creative-director-web-designer-verda-wins-young-entrepreneur-award</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;
	  
          &lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-sdl_editor_representation&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-drop-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- scald=277:sdl_editor_representation {&quot;option&quot;:&quot;{\u201clink\u201d:\u201d\u201c}&quot;} --&gt;&lt;div class=&#039;image&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.verdadesign.com/assets/thumbnails/image/madison-zyluk-verda-design_0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;madison-zyluk-verda-design.jpg&quot; title=&quot;madison-zyluk-verda-design.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- END scald=277 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce that Madison Zyluk has won this year’s 2015 Young Entrepreneur Award from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WOMB&lt;/span&gt;. The event took place in May at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RBC&lt;/span&gt; Convention Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madison started the company at the age of 21 and now we are going on our 6th year of business in Winnipeg. We’ve specialized in responsive web design from the start and as far as I know we are actually the first in the city of Winnipeg to start offering this service. Madison realized there was a need for cutting edge services in Winnipeg and focused her attention on creating high quality design pieces and web sites that capture the value and vibe that each client is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey over the years has been amazing and shaped us and our firm to be the best we can be from our process to the work we output. During our 5 years in business we’ve had the pleasure of working with a multitude of companies small to big in Winnipeg and all throughout Canada. Each client has provided us with valuable insight and feedback which we have incorporated in our process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve included a story Madison shared in her submission about the early days before we had an office and she was just starting out. Our story of how we came to be is not something that is known to all our our clients but these moments have been pivotal turning points for our company and in our lives in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Madison Words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can recall the exact moment when I knew that starting my own business is what I needed to accomplish to be fulfilled in my career and in life. I was standing in a pub where the college I went to had reserved the entire second floor for our graduating class on the night of the graduation after party. Everyone congratulated each other for the achievement of finishing the three-year graphic design program at Red River College. I had won two scholarships during my time in college for outstanding achievement and finished with some of the highest marks on record! Despite my academic success, I recall having an unsettling feeling of knowing this was only the beginning of my journey and I was embarking down a new path towards the business world. I was&lt;br /&gt;
surrounded by the toasts and cheerful uproars of my classmates and I knew that first thing tomorrow I would be starting to take the first steps towards establishing my own full service web/graphic design company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 21 at the time and I knew that there would no longer be someone there to guide me and offer advice on a daily basis. I was leaving design school equipped with a great design skill-set, but I needed more real world business experience and appreciation of how cut-throat the design industry could actually be. Even looking back now to five years ago, that decision to start fresh out of college took an enormous amount of courage and confidence. I was in - all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew instinctively that this was my dream which I felt was imperative to accomplish in my lifetime, but I didn’t know exactly how. The “how” part came slowly and evolved with time as I found out who my clients were and what they were looking for. I had an initial business plan, but as time went on the plan changed and I adapted it to meet my clients’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the goals I wanted to achieve were goals that only I could ensure would come to fruition. I never wanted to look back at my life and say I didn’t live my dream like so many I have known had. Untapped potential is a sad thing to see and I wasn’t going to let the fear of failure dictate my future. I was bracing myself to take the plunge into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my client base grew that first year I began to gain a greater understanding of what kind of design services were in demand. The number one question I heard time and time again was “Can you make me a website?”. At the time, my production, illustration and print design skills were sharp. I was able to provide an amazing service in this area, however when it came to web in early 2010 I fell short. It was clear that this was where the future was and there was a niche for high quality websites in Winnipeg that needed to be filled. I had some experience with coding and development but there’s a saying in our industry that you can either be a great designer or a great developer - if you can do both the likelihood is you cannot do both very well. It became clear that I needed some help on the development end if I was to offer the best product and service to my clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to how I found Jordan, who is now my full time web developer and 50% business partner at Verda Design. I knew Jordan from high school and we both had gone to Collège Béliveau, a French immersion school in Winnipeg. Although we barely spoke during high school I knew he was in the computer science faculty at the University of Manitoba and that he was someone who was smart and a quick learner. I reached out to him and asked if he could help me out with a website project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One web project then became two and has led to an enriching business partnership. This was a very pivotal point in the company’s growth. I know without adapting and making the transition to offering high quality websites we would not be as successful as we are today. I should also mention that during the next few years it was as if I was in school again learning from Jordan. He assisted me in becoming more knowledgeable about computer science in relation to designing for optimal user experience, the importance of a user friendly layout and about hosting and optimizing websites to improve rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fine-tuned my web design skills and began to focus heavily on social media both for our company and our clients. Social media is actually how we found our first three big clients, or rather how they were able to find us. After completing several projects we finally had the capital we needed to acquire our own office space. We leased a small office in the exchange district in an heritage building. This was to be my home away from home for the next two years where I would be spending countless hours working. The space was small and modest and served its purpose as a meeting area for clients and professional work space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent every day at this office and rarely saw my friends the first three years of my business. Throughout that time our company continued to grow in a multitude of ways and all the while we continued to keep our quality of work high as we began to expand our services. As we acquired more clients and larger projects we moved into a more stylish two-room office that was one street over in a building on Arthur St., which is where we are currently located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the past five years of what it took for me to succeed in business can be easily expressed by a famous quote by Charles Darwin. “It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.” The “change” he speaks of is the ability and tenacity to strive for better, for more each day and reevaluate the manner in which things are done and to do them most efficiently. It is successful adaptation to industry trends, life changes and on a project by project basis that has given me the success that many of my competition have not had. Adaptability has been the difference from being able to merely cope with situations and adapting and reshaping strategies to succeed. I owe my success to my talent, my ability to adapt and to problem-solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this year we have worked on over 200 projects, with over 100 clients in Winnipeg and all over Canada. I bring a passion for the work I do everyday, from meeting with new and existing clients, digital market consulting and my first and true love – graphic design. We have purposely stayed a two-person design firm because we love what we do and it brings us great joy. We plan on expanding in the future as our client base continues to grow so we can provide the best customer service but right now we are living the dream and enjoying the ride.”&lt;/p&gt;
